## Build instructions:

1. Set up build environment as per Google documentation

https://source.android.com/docs/setup/start/requirements

* The `libarchive-tools` package is also necessary to patch the toolchain.
* The `ccache` package is necessary if you wish to build with CCache (Quicker subsequest builds)

2. Properly clone repository with submodules (KernelSU and toolchains)

```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ocin4ever/EternityKernel/.git```

3.1) Build for International variant (d2s in this case)

```./build.sh d2s```

3.2) Build for Korean variant (d2xks in this case)

```./build.sh d2x N```

4. Fetch the flashable zip of the kernel that was just compiled

```build/out/[your_device]/EternityKernel...zip```

5. Flash it using a supported recovery like EternityTWRP or ExtremeTWRP

6. Enjoy!
